About this Software:
Until now, all of my work has been closed-source. I have always worked independently and entirely on my own. 
Everything I have built has been done only on my local computer, and everything I create is formally protected by law. 
Only now, in my later years, I have published something here on GitHub for the first time. 
Except for what I publish here on this GitHub page (https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer), 
all of my software projects remain closed-source.

To prevent abuse or phishing, there are no other websites, email addresses, 
or communication channels connected to the software on this page except the listed email address.  
If you find the code or binaries anywhere else than on
https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer it is abuse, a scam, and theft of law-protected intellectual property.  
In such a case, please inform GitHub and send me an email.

If I ever decide to write a license for the binary, so that other people may at least be allowed to download the executable or installer,  
this text will also include the license and the exact location where the binaries can be downloaded.

 ### A simple, secure OAuth GoogleMail client for sending files. Creates native Explorer folders linked on the desktop. Contents added to the folder are sent automatically from the configured sender email address to the configured receiver email address.


 ## Features

### - Gmail OAuth 2.0 authentication without persisting OAuth tokens.

### - Google client_secret.json file is stored in secure encrypted PKCS#12 database

### - Application startup access password protection

### - Sender email address is stored in secure encrypted PKCS#12 database

### - Recipient email address is stored in secure encrypted PKCS#12 database

### - One Time setup of Sender and Receiver Address

### - Files added to the local "Outgoing Things" Desktop link folder are sent automatically to a predefined recipient via Gmail.

### - Generates at setup time internal Mail Folder Names using UUIDs for additional abuse prevention (application decides the real folder name).

### - Uses the generated UUID in both the client name and email metadata for additional verifiability

### - Moves sent files to a "Sent Things" Desktop link folder for archiving.
